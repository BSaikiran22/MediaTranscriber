Yes, you can copy and paste the content I provided into your README.md file. However, you should make sure to customize the following parts to fit your specific project:

Project Name: Replace Media Transcriber with your project’s name (if it's different).
Your Name: In the license section, update [Your Name] with your name or GitHub username.
Year: Replace [year] with the current year.
After that, the README.md file will be ready with clear instructions on how to set up, use, and contribute to your project. Once updated, don't forget to commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository.

Let me know if you need further assistance with anything!

# Media Transcriber

This project is a simple media transcription tool built with Python, leveraging Whisper for audio and video transcription. The application takes media files (audio or video), processes them, and saves the transcription in a structured format (JSON).

## Features

- Supports audio and video file transcription.
- Utilizes [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) for speech-to-text conversion.
- Outputs transcriptions in JSON format.
- Option to process media files in bulk by parsing folders.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

- Python 3.x
- FFmpeg (for media processing)
- Whisper (installed via pip)

You will also need to have your **GitHub account** set up for version control.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BSaikiran22/MediaTranscriber.git
   cd MediaTranscriber/src
Install dependencies:

Make sure you have Python and pip installed. Then, install the necessary libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file contains the necessary libraries, including Whisper and any additional dependencies.

Setup FFmpeg:

Ensure you have FFmpeg installed on your system to process audio and video files. Download FFmpeg here and follow the installation instructions for your platform.

Usage
Place your media files (audio or video) in a folder.

python app.py
The transcription will be saved as a .json file in the output directory, named after the media file.

Example:
For a media file named audio.mp3, the output will be saved as:

bash
Copy
Edit
C:/Users/SAI/Desktop/files/audio.mp3.json
